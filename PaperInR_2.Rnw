\begin{abstract}
This is an example on how to make a reproducible paper. We are using R from Rstudio, creating an RSweave document. This is a nice start to create a nice paper and get an A+. The next sections will show the steps taken.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
This is my intro to my great paper, I will explain the cool things I can do with my new `computational thinking' powers combined with some Latex.

\section{Explaining Labels}\label{outline}

Sections may use a label\footnote{In fact, you can have a label wherever you think a future reference to that content might be needed.}. This label is needed for referencing. For example the next section has label \emph{datas}, so you can reference it by writing: As we see in section \ref{datas}.

\section{Data analysis}\label{datas}

Here you can explain how to get the data.%echo=TRUE, see the code; eval=TRUE, run the code (false is opposite)

<<gettingData, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE>>= MH-gettingdata is title of code for ToC
# echo: show the code?
# eval: run the code?

# link has been previously shortened
linkToData="https://goo.gl/So48s5"
# getting the data from link:
states=read.csv(linkToData)

@

\subsection{Exploration}\label{eda}

Here, I start exploring the data. The first step is to know what variables I have, and in what scale they are:


<<verifying, echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE>>=
str(states)
# you may try: str(states, width = 60, strict.width = "cut")
@

%% THIS IS HOW YOU CREATE BULLETS:

A next step demands:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Knowing the \emph{central} and \emph{dispersion} values.
  \item Visualizing the variables of interest.
\end{itemize}

Except for the column \emph{state} and \emph{region}, we can compute the centrality and spread measures for the other variables in the data. I will do that in Table\ref{measures} in the next page.

%% HERE FORCING TO END THE PAGE!
\clearpage  

% THIS COMES IN NEXT PAGE:

<<meanspread,echo=FALSE,results=tex,eval=TRUE>>=
# notice "results=tex": give me the output in LATEX!!

# stargazer need to be previously installed.
library(stargazer)
stargazer(states[,-c(1,8)],title = "Mean and Spread values", label = "measures")
@

As you saw, my Table \ref{measures} is nice. As you saw, the mean of the variable \emph{satMean} is \Sexpr{mean(states$satMean, na.rm = T)}. Now let's use a boxplot to explore location:

%% above you could try \Sexpr{round(mean(states$satMean, na.rm = T),2)}

%%%%%%%
% figure 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
<<location,echo=FALSE, fig=TRUE,eval=TRUE,height=4.6>>=
# notice "fig=TRUE"
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
boxplot(states$satMean)
boxplot(states$satDemand)
boxplot(states$k12ExpenditurePupil)
@
\caption{Location of values}
\label{plot_boxplots}
\end{figure}

\clearpage
As we have a categorical variable, we could create a frequency table:

<<tableCat2,echo=TRUE>>=
tableF=data.frame(table(states$region),row.names = NULL)
names(tableF)=c("Region", 'Frequency')
tableF
@

It will look better in a while!
